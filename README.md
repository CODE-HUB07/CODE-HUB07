👋 Hey there! I'm **Siddhant** — a curious mind with a keyboard, currently diving deep into the world of **Computer Science** at S.A.T.I. Polytechnic.

🔧 I love turning ideas into code and caffeine into logic. Whether it's designing a slick user interface or debugging a stubborn error at 2 AM — I'm here for it.

🌱 Currently exploring:
- 🚀 Web development (React, Node.js, REST APIs)
- 🧠 Algorithms and data structures
- ⚙️ System-level fundamentals (because under the hood matters too!)

🛠️ Languages & Tools:
 `JavaScript` | `Python` | `HTML/CSS`  
`VS Code` | `Git` |  `Chrome DevTools`

💡 I believe in building first, then perfecting. Learning by doing is my **MANTRA**.

📂 Always open to collaboration, crazy ideas, or just a good tech chat.  
📫 Let's connect, code, and create something awesome together!
